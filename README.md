## Overview
In this project work, we did the animated waves using the HTML and CSS. HTML used for "skeleton" of the project, with help of CSS we did closer design to the original project. We tried to do as close as possible design of the project and added our creative to improve the appearence of our work.

### The challenge
The main components that we should be able to:
- Properly choosed colors and font styles. 
- Closest design.

## Our process

First of all, we created the skeleton of the project. We used HTML and created different divs for our waves. Secondly, according to our HTML we created CSS part. On CSS part we gave the value to colors,dimensions of objects,backgrounds etc. Furthermore, we decided to add the text "Wave" to improve our design.

### Built with

- HTML 
- CSS 


### What We learned

During the process, we learned animating the objects with CSS. It was an amazing journey.
In addition, we learned @keyframes function.

The @keyframes rule specifies the animation code.

The animation is created by gradually changing from one set of CSS styles to another.

During the animation, you can change the set of CSS styles many times.

Specify when the style change will happen in percent, or with the keywords "from" and "to", which is the same as 0% and 100%. 0% is the beginning of the animation, 100% is when the animation is complete.

### Continued development

We are just started to learn programming languages. Using the CSS for animations opened new side of using it! I believe we will continue to learn new features of programming languages and use them for further self-development.
